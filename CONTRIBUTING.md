## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v10.28.1 or later

### Setup

1. fork and clone the repository
2. install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. (optional) if you want to test the admin UI/flow, you can run the local connector:

   ```bash
   pnpm npmx-connector
   ```

## Development workflow

### Available commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start development server
pnpm build            # Production build
pnpm preview          # Preview production build

# Connector
pnpm npmx-connector   # Start the real connector (requires npm login)
pnpm mock-connector   # Start the mock connector (no npm login needed)

# Code Quality
pnpm lint             # Run linter (oxlint + oxfmt)
pnpm lint:fix         # Auto-fix lint issues
pnpm test:types       # TypeScript type checking

# Testing
pnpm test             # Run all Vitest tests
pnpm test:unit        # Unit tests only
pnpm test:nuxt        # Nuxt component tests
pnpm test:browser     # Playwright E2E tests
pnpm test:a11y        # Lighthouse accessibility audits
pnpm test:perf        # Lighthouse performance audits (CLS)
```

### Clearing caches during development

Nitro persists `defineCachedEventHandler` results to disk at `.nuxt/cache/nitro/`. This cache **survives dev server restarts**. If you're iterating on a cached API route and want fresh results, delete the relevant cache directory:

```bash
# Clear all Nitro handler caches
rm -rf .nuxt/cache/nitro/handlers/

# Clear a specific handler cache (e.g. picks)
rm -rf .nuxt/cache/nitro/handlers/npmx-picks/
```

Alternatively, you can bypass the cache entirely in development by adding `shouldBypassCache: () => import.meta.dev` to your `defineCachedEventHandler` options:

```ts
export default defineCachedEventHandler(
  async event => {
    // ...
  },
  {
    maxAge: 60 * 5,
    shouldBypassCache: () => import.meta.dev,
  },
)
```

The `.cache/` directory is a separate storage mount used for fetch-cache and atproto data.

### Local connector CLI

The `cli/` workspace contains a local connector that enables authenticated npm operations from the web UI. It runs on your machine and uses your existing npm credentials.

```bash
# run the connector from the root of the repository
pnpm npmx-connector
```

The connector will check your npm authentication, generate a connection token, and listen for requests from npmx.dev.

### Mock connector (for local development)

If you're working on admin features (org management, package access controls, operations queue) and don't want to use your real npm account, you can run the mock connector instead:

```bash
pnpm mock-connector
```

This starts a mock connector server pre-populated with sample data (orgs, teams, members, packages). No npm login is required &mdash; operations succeed immediately without making real npm CLI calls.

The mock connector prints a connection URL to the terminal, just like the real connector. Click it (or paste the token manually) to connect the UI.

**Options:**

```bash
pnpm mock-connector                # default: port 31415, user "mock-user", sample data
pnpm mock-connector --port 9999    # custom port
pnpm mock-connector --user alice   # custom username
pnpm mock-connector --empty        # start with no pre-populated data
```

**Default sample data:**

- **@nuxt**: 4 members (mock-user, danielroe, pi0, antfu), 3 teams (core, docs, triage)
- **@unjs**: 2 members (mock-user, pi0), 1 team (maintainers)
- **Packages**: @nuxt/kit, @nuxt/schema, @unjs/nitro with team-based access controls

> [!TIP]
> Run `pnpm dev` in a separate terminal to start the Nuxt dev server, then click the connection URL from the mock connector to connect.

## Code style

When committing changes, try to keep an eye out for unintended formatting updates. These can make a pull request look noisier than it really is and slow down the review process. Sometimes IDEs automatically reformat files on save, which can unintentionally introduce extra changes.

To help with this, the project uses `oxfmt` to handle formatting via a pre-commit hook. The hook will automatically reformat files when needed. If something can’t be fixed automatically, it will let you know what needs to be updated before you can commit.

If you want to get ahead of any formatting issues, you can also run `pnpm lint:fix` before committing to fix formatting across the whole project.

### npmx name

When displaying the project name anywhere in the UI, use `npmx` in all lowercase letters.

### TypeScript

- We care about good types &ndash; never cast things to `any` 💪
- Validate rather than just assert

### Server API patterns

#### Input validation with Valibot

Use Valibot schemas from `#shared/schemas/` to validate API inputs. This ensures type safety and provides consistent error messages:

```typescript
import * as v from 'valibot'
import { PackageRouteParamsSchema } from '#shared/schemas/package'

// In your handler:
const { packageName, version } = v.parse(PackageRouteParamsSchema, {
  packageName: rawPackageName,
  version: rawVersion,
})
```

#### Error handling with `handleApiError`

Use the `handleApiError` utility for consistent error handling in API routes. It re-throws H3 errors (like 404s) and wraps other errors with a fallback message:

```typescript
import { ERROR_NPM_FETCH_FAILED } from '#shared/utils/constants'

try {
  // API logic...
} catch (error: unknown) {
  handleApiError(error, {
    statusCode: 502,
    message: ERROR_NPM_FETCH_FAILED,
  })
}
```

#### URL parameter parsing with `parsePackageParams`

Use `parsePackageParams` to extract package name and version from URL segments:

```typescript
const pkgParamSegments = getRouterParam(event, 'pkg')?.split('/') ?? []
const { rawPackageName, rawVersion } = parsePackageParams(pkgParamSegments)
```

This handles patterns like `/pkg`, `/pkg/v/1.0.0`, `/@scope/pkg`, and `/@scope/pkg/v/1.0.0`.

#### Constants

Define error messages and other string constants in `#shared/utils/constants.ts` to ensure consistency across the codebase:

```typescript
export const ERROR_NPM_FETCH_FAILED = 'Failed to fetch package from npm registry.'
```

### Import order

1. Type imports first (`import type { ... }`)
2. External packages
3. Internal aliases (`#shared/types`, `#server/`, etc.)
4. No blank lines between groups

```typescript
import type { Packument, NpmSearchResponse } from '#shared/types'
import type { Tokens } from 'marked'
import { marked } from 'marked'
import { hasProtocol } from 'ufo'
```

### Naming conventions

| Type             | Convention               | Example                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Vue components   | PascalCase               | `DateTime.vue`                 |
| Pages            | kebab-case               | `search.vue`, `[...name].vue`  |
| Composables      | camelCase + `use` prefix | `useNpmRegistry.ts`            |
| Server routes    | kebab-case + method      | `search.get.ts`                |
| Functions        | camelCase                | `fetchPackage`, `formatDate`   |
| Constants        | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE     | `NPM_REGISTRY`, `ALLOWED_TAGS` |
| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase               | `NpmSearchResponse`            |

### Vue components

- Use Composition API with `<script setup lang="ts">`
- Define props with TypeScript: `defineProps<{ text: string }>()`
- Keep functions under 50 lines
- Accessibility is a first-class consideration &ndash; always consider ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import type { PackumentVersion } from '#shared/types'

const props = defineProps<{
  version: PackumentVersion
}>()
</script>
```

Ideally, extract utilities into separate files so they can be unit tested. 🙏

### Internal linking

Always use **object syntax with named routes** for internal navigation. This makes links resilient to URL structure changes and provides type safety via `unplugin-vue-router`.

```vue
<!-- Good: named route -->
<NuxtLink :to="{ name: 'settings' }">Settings</NuxtLink>

<!-- Bad: string path -->
<NuxtLink to="/settings">Settings</NuxtLink>
```

The same applies to programmatic navigation:

```typescript
// Good
navigateTo({ name: 'compare' })
router.push({ name: 'search' })

// Bad
navigateTo('/compare')
router.push('/search')
```

For routes with parameters, pass them explicitly:

```vue
<NuxtLink :to="{ name: '~username', params: { username } }">Profile</NuxtLink>
<NuxtLink :to="{ name: 'org', params: { org: orgName } }">Organization</NuxtLink>
```

Query parameters work as expected:

```vue
<NuxtLink :to="{ name: 'compare', query: { packages: pkg.name } }">Compare</NuxtLink>
```

#### Package routes

For package links, use the auto-imported `packageRoute()` utility from `app/utils/router.ts`. It handles scoped/unscoped packages and optional versions:

```vue
<!-- Links to /package/vue -->
<NuxtLink :to="packageRoute('vue')">vue</NuxtLink>

<!-- Links to /package/@nuxt/kit -->
<NuxtLink :to="packageRoute('@nuxt/kit')">@nuxt/kit</NuxtLink>

<!-- Links to /package/vue/v/3.5.0 -->
<NuxtLink :to="packageRoute('vue', '3.5.0')">vue@3.5.0</NuxtLink>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never construct package URLs as strings. The route structure uses separate `org` and `name` params, and `packageRoute()` handles the splitting correctly.

#### Available route names

| Route name        | URL pattern                       | Parameters                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `index`           | `/`                               | &mdash;                   |
| `about`           | `/about`                          | &mdash;                   |
| `compare`         | `/compare`                        | &mdash;                   |
| `privacy`         | `/privacy`                        | &mdash;                   |
| `search`          | `/search`                         | &mdash;                   |
| `settings`        | `/settings`                       | &mdash;                   |
| `package`         | `/package/:org?/:name`            | `org?`, `name`            |
| `package-version` | `/package/:org?/:name/v/:version` | `org?`, `name`, `version` |
| `code`            | `/package-code/:path+`            | `path` (array)            |
| `docs`            | `/package-docs/:path+`            | `path` (array)            |
| `org`             | `/org/:org`                       | `org`                     |
| `~username`       | `/~:username`                     | `username`                |
| `~username-orgs`  | `/~:username/orgs`                | `username`                |

### Cursor and navigation

**npmx** uses `cursor: pointer` only for links to match users’ everyday experience. For all other interactive elements, including buttons, use the default cursor (_or another appropriate cursor to indicate state_).

> [!NOTE]
> A link is any element that leads to another content (_go to another page, authorize_)
> A button is any element that operates an action (_show tooltip, open menu, "like" package, open dropdown_)
> If you're unsure which element to use - feel free to ask question in the issue or on discord

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always Prefer implementing navigation as real links whenever possible. This ensures they can be opened in a new tab, shared or reloaded, and so the same content is available at a stable URL

## RTL Support

We support `right-to-left` languages, we need to make sure that the UI is working correctly in both directions.

Simple approach used by most websites of relying on direction set in HTML element does not work because direction for various items, such as timeline, does not always match direction set in HTML.

We've added some `UnoCSS` utilities styles to help you with that:

- Do not use `left/right` padding and margin: for example `pl-1`. Use `padding-inline-start/end` instead. So `pl-1` should be `ps-1`, `pr-1` should be `pe-1`. The same rules apply to margin.
- Do not use `rtl-` classes, such as `rtl-left-0`.
- For icons that should be rotated for RTL, add `class="rtl-flip"`. This can only be used for icons outside of elements with `dir="auto"`.
- For absolute positioned elements, don't use `left/right`: for example `left-0`. Use `inset-inline-start/end` instead. `UnoCSS` shortcuts are `inset-is` for `inset-inline-start` and `inset-ie` for `inset-inline-end`. Example: `left-0` should be replaced with `inset-is-0`.
- If you need to change the border radius for an entire left or right side, use `border-inline-start/end`. `UnoCSS` shortcuts are `rounded-is` for left side, `rounded-ie` for right side. Example: `rounded-l-5` should be replaced with `rounded-is-5`.
- If you need to change the border radius for one corner, use `border-start-end-radius` and similar rules. `UnoCSS` shortcuts are `rounded` + top/bottom as either `-bs` (top) or `-be` (bottom) + left/right as either `-is` (left) or `-ie` (right). Example: `rounded-tl-0` should be replaced with `rounded-bs-is-0`.

## Localization (i18n)

npmx.dev uses [@nuxtjs/i18n](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/) for internationalization. We aim to make the UI accessible to users in their preferred language.

### Approach

- All user-facing strings should use translation keys via `$t()` in templates and script
- Translation files live in [`i18n/locales/`](i18n/locales) (e.g., `en-US.json`)
- We use the `no_prefix` strategy (no `/en-US/` or `/fr-FR/` in URLs)
- Locale preference is stored in `localStorage` and respected on subsequent visits

### i18n commands

The following scripts help manage translation files. `en.json` is the reference locale.

| Command                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm i18n:check [locale]`     | Compares `en.json` with other locale files. Shows missing and extra keys. Optionally filter output by locale (e.g. `pnpm i18n:check ja-JP`).                                            |
| `pnpm i18n:check:fix [locale]` | Same as check, but adds missing keys to other locales with English placeholders.                                                                                                        |
| `pnpm i18n:report`             | Audits translation keys against code usage in `.vue` and `.ts` files. Reports missing keys (used in code but not in locale), unused keys (in locale but not in code), and dynamic keys. |
| `pnpm i18n:report:fix`         | Removes unused keys from `en.json` and all other locale files.                                                                                                                          |

### Adding a new locale

We are using localization using country variants (ISO-6391) via [multiple translation files](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/docs/guide/lazy-load-translations#multiple-files-lazy-loading) to avoid repeating every key per country.

The [config/i18n.ts](./config/i18n.ts) configuration file will be used to register the new locale:

- `countryLocaleVariants` object will be used to register the country variants
- `locales` object will be used to link the supported locales (country and single one)
- `buildLocales` function will build the target locales

To add a new locale:

1. Create a new JSON file in [`i18n/locales/`](./i18n/locales) with the locale code as the filename (e.g., `uk-UA.json`, `de-DE.json`)
2. Copy [`en.json`](./i18n/locales/en.json) and translate the strings
3. Add the locale to the `locales` array in [config/i18n.ts](./config/i18n.ts):

   ```typescript
   {
     code: 'uk-UA',        // Must match the filename (without .json)
     file: 'uk-UA.json',
     name: 'Українська',   // Native name of the language
   },
   ```

4. Copy your translation file to `lunaria/files/` for translation tracking:

   ```bash
   cp i18n/locales/uk-UA.json lunaria/files/uk-UA.json
   ```

   > ⚠**Important:**
   > This file must be committed. Lunaria uses git history to track translation progress, so the build will fail if this file is missing.

5. If the language is `right-to-left`, add `dir: 'rtl'` (see `ar-EG` in config for example)
6. If the language requires special pluralization rules, add a `pluralRule` callback (see `ar-EG` or `ru-RU` in config for examples)

Check [Pluralization rule callback](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/pluralization#custom-pluralization) and [Plural Rules](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules#TOC-Determining-Plural-Categories) for more info.

### Update translation

We track the current progress of translations with [Lunaria](https://lunaria.dev/) on this site: https://i18n.npmx.dev/
If you see any outdated translations in your language, feel free to update the keys to match the English version.

Use `pnpm i18n:check` and `pnpm i18n:check:fix` to verify and fix your locale (see [i18n commands](#i18n-commands) above for details).

#### Country variants (advanced)

Most languages only need a single locale file. Country variants are only needed when you want to support regional differences (e.g., `es-ES` for Spain vs `es-419` for Latin America).

If you need country variants:

1. Create a base language file (e.g., `es.json`) with all translations
2. Create country variant files (e.g., `es-ES.json`, `es-419.json`) with only the differing translations
3. Register the base language in `locales` and add variants to `countryLocaleVariants`

See how `es`, `es-ES`, and `es-419` are configured in [config/i18n.ts](./config/i18n.ts) for a complete example.

### Adding translations

1. Add your translation key to `i18n/locales/en.json` first (American English is the source of truth)
2. Use the key in your component:

   ```vue
   <template>
     <p>{{ $t('my.translation.key') }}</p>
   </template>
   ```

   Or in script:

   ```typescript
   <script setup lang="ts">
   const message = computed(() => $t('my.translation.key'))
   </script>
   ```

3. For dynamic values, use interpolation:

   ```json
   { "greeting": "Hello, {name}!" }
   ```

   ```vue
   <p>{{ $t('greeting', { name: userName }) }}</p>
   ```

4. Don't concatenate string messages in the Vue templates, some languages can have different word order. Use placeholders instead.

   **Bad:**

   ```vue
   <p>{{ $t('hello') }} {{ userName }}</p>
   ```

   **Good:**

   ```vue
   <p>{{ $t('greeting', { name: userName }) }}</p>
   ```

   **Complex content:**

   If you need to include HTML or components inside the translation, use [`i18n-t`](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/advanced/component.html) component. This is especially useful when the order of elements might change between languages.

   ```json
   {
     "agreement": "I accept the {terms} and {privacy}.",
     "terms_link": "Terms of Service",
     "privacy_policy": "Privacy Policy"
   }
   ```

   ```vue
   <i18n-t keypath="agreement" tag="p">
     <template #terms>
       <NuxtLink to="/terms">{{ $t('terms_link') }}</NuxtLink>
     </template>
     <template #privacy>
       <strong>{{ $t('privacy_policy') }}</strong>
     </template>
   </i18n-t>
   ```

### Translation key conventions

- Use dot notation for hierarchy: `section.subsection.key`
- Keep keys descriptive but concise
- Group related keys together
- Use `common.*` for shared strings (loading, retry, close, etc.)
- Use component-specific prefixes: `package.card.*`, `settings.*`, `nav.*`
- Do not use dashes (`-`) in translation keys; always use underscore (`_`): e.g., `privacy_policy` instead of `privacy-policy`
- **Always use static string literals as translation keys.** Our i18n scripts (`pnpm i18n:report`) rely on static analysis to detect unused and missing keys. Dynamic keys cannot be analyzed and will be flagged as errors.

  **Bad:**

  ```vue
  <!-- Template literal -->
  <p>{{ $t(`package.tabs.${tab}`) }}</p>

  <!-- Variable -->
  <p>{{ $t(myKey) }}</p>
  ```

  **Good:**

  ```typescript
  const { t } = useI18n()

  const tabLabels = computed(() => ({
    readme: t('package.tabs.readme'),
    versions: t('package.tabs.versions'),
  }))
  ```

  ```vue
  <p>{{ tabLabels[tab] }}</p>
  ```

### Using i18n-ally (recommended)

We recommend the [i18n-ally](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lokalise.i18n-ally) VSCode extension for a better development experience:

- Inline translation previews in your code
- Auto-completion for translation keys
- Missing translation detection
- Easy navigation to translation files

The extension is included in our workspace recommendations, so VSCode should prompt you to install it.

### Formatting numbers and dates

Use vue-i18n's built-in formatters for locale-aware formatting:

```vue
<template>
  <p>{{ $n(12345) }}</p>
  <!-- "12,345" in en-US, "12 345" in fr-FR -->
  <p>{{ $d(new Date()) }}</p>
  <!-- locale-aware date -->
</template>
```

## Testing

### Unit tests

Write unit tests for core functionality using Vitest:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'

describe('featureName', () => {
  it('should handle expected case', () => {
    expect(result).toBe(expected)
  })
})
```

> [!TIP]
> If you need access to the Nuxt context in your unit or component test, place your test in the `test/nuxt/` directory and run with `pnpm test:nuxt`

### Component accessibility tests

All Vue components should have accessibility tests in `test/nuxt/a11y.spec.ts`. These tests use [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) to catch common accessibility violations and run in a real browser environment via Playwright.

```typescript
import { MyComponent } from '#components'

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should have no accessibility violations', async () => {
    const component = await mountSuspended(MyComponent, {
      props: {
        /* required props */
      },
    })
    const results = await runAxe(component)
    expect(results.violations).toEqual([])
  })
})
```

The `runAxe` helper handles DOM isolation and disables page-level rules that don't apply to isolated component testing.

A coverage test in `test/unit/a11y-component-coverage.spec.ts` ensures all components are either tested or explicitly skipped with justification. When you add a new component, this test will fail until you add accessibility tests for it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Just because axe-core doesn't find any obvious issues, it does not mean a component is accessible. Please do additional checks and use best practices.

### Lighthouse accessibility tests

In addition to component-level axe audits, the project runs full-page accessibility audits using [Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci). These test the rendered pages in both light and dark mode against Lighthouse's accessibility category, requiring a perfect score.

#### How it works

1. The project is built in test mode (`pnpm build:test`), which activates server-side fixture mocking
2. Lighthouse CI starts a preview server and audits three URLs: `/`, `/search?q=nuxt`, and `/package/nuxt`
3. A Puppeteer setup script (`lighthouse-setup.cjs`) runs before each audit to set the color mode and intercept client-side API requests using the same fixtures as the E2E tests

#### Running locally

```bash
# Build + run both light and dark audits
pnpm test:a11y

# Or against an existing test build
pnpm test:a11y:prebuilt

# Or run a single color mode manually
pnpm build:test
LIGHTHOUSE_COLOR_MODE=dark ./scripts/lighthouse.sh
```

This requires Chrome or Chromium to be installed. The script will auto-detect common installation paths. Results are printed to the terminal and saved in `.lighthouseci/`.

#### Configuration

| File                    | Purpose                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.lighthouserc.cjs`     | Lighthouse CI config (URLs, assertions, Chrome path)      |
| `lighthouse-setup.cjs`  | Puppeteer script for color mode + client-side API mocking |
| `scripts/lighthouse.sh` | Shell wrapper that runs the audit for a given color mode  |

### Lighthouse performance tests

The project also runs Lighthouse performance audits to enforce zero Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). These run separately from the accessibility audits and test the same set of URLs.

#### How it works

The same `.lighthouserc.cjs` config is shared between accessibility and performance audits. When the `LH_PERF` environment variable is set, the config switches from the `accessibility` category to the `performance` category and asserts that CLS is exactly 0.

#### Running locally

```bash
# Build + run performance audit
pnpm test:perf

# Or against an existing test build
pnpm test:perf:prebuilt
```

Unlike the accessibility audits, performance audits do not run in separate light/dark modes.

### End to end tests

Write end-to-end tests using Playwright:

```bash
pnpm test:browser        # Run tests
pnpm test:browser:ui     # Run with Playwright UI
```

Make sure to read about [Playwright best practices](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices) and don't rely on classes/IDs but try to follow user-replicable behaviour (like selecting an element based on text content instead).

### Test fixtures (mocking external APIs)

E2E tests use a fixture system to mock external API requests, ensuring tests are deterministic and don't hit real APIs. This is handled at two levels:

**Server-side mocking** (`modules/fixtures.ts` + `modules/runtime/server/cache.ts`):

- Intercepts all `$fetch` calls during SSR
- Serves pre-recorded fixture data from `test/fixtures/`
- Enabled via `NUXT_TEST_FIXTURES=true` or Nuxt test mode

**Client-side mocking** (`test/fixtures/mock-routes.cjs`):

- Shared URL matching and response generation logic used by both Playwright E2E tests and Lighthouse CI
- Playwright tests (`test/e2e/test-utils.ts`) use this via `page.route()` interception
- Lighthouse tests (`lighthouse-setup.cjs`) use this via Puppeteer request interception
- All E2E test files import from `./test-utils` instead of `@nuxt/test-utils/playwright`
- Throws a clear error if an unmocked external request is detected

#### Fixture files

Fixtures are stored in `test/fixtures/` with this structure:

```
test/fixtures/
├── npm-registry/
│   ├── packuments/       # Package metadata (vue.json, @nuxt/kit.json)
│   ├── search/           # Search results (vue.json, nuxt.json)
│   └── orgs/             # Org package lists (nuxt.json)
├── npm-api/
│   └── downloads/        # Download stats
└── users/                # User package lists
```

#### Adding new fixtures

1. **Generate fixtures** using the script:

   ```bash
   pnpm generate:fixtures vue lodash @nuxt/kit
   ```

2. **Or manually create** a JSON file in the appropriate directory

#### Environment variables

| Variable                          | Purpose                            |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `NUXT_TEST_FIXTURES=true`         | Enable server-side fixture mocking |
| `NUXT_TEST_FIXTURES_VERBOSE=true` | Enable detailed fixture logging    |

#### When tests fail due to missing fixtures

If a test fails with an error like:

```
UNMOCKED EXTERNAL API REQUEST DETECTED
API:  npm registry
URL:  https://registry.npmjs.org/some-package
```

You need to either:

1. Add a fixture file for that package/endpoint
2. Update the mock handlers in `test/fixtures/mock-routes.cjs` (client) or `modules/runtime/server/cache.ts` (server)

### Testing connector features

Features that require authentication through the local connector (org management, package collaborators, operations queue) are tested using a mock connector server.

#### Architecture

The mock connector infrastructure is shared between the CLI, E2E tests, and Vitest component tests:

```
cli/src/
├── types.ts           # ConnectorEndpoints contract (shared by real + mock)
├── mock-state.ts      # MockConnectorStateManager (canonical source)
├── mock-app.ts        # H3 mock app + MockConnectorServer class
└── mock-server.ts     # CLI entry point (pnpm mock-connector)

test/test-utils/       # Re-exports from cli/src/ for test convenience
test/e2e/helpers/      # E2E-specific wrappers (fixtures, global setup)
```

Both the real server (`cli/src/server.ts`) and the mock server (`cli/src/mock-app.ts`) conform to the `ConnectorEndpoints` interface defined in `cli/src/types.ts`. This ensures the API contract is enforced by TypeScript. When adding a new endpoint, update `ConnectorEndpoints` first, then implement it in both servers.

#### Vitest component tests (`test/nuxt/`)

- Mock the `useConnector` composable with reactive state
- Use `document.body` queries for components using Teleport
- See `test/nuxt/components/HeaderConnectorModal.spec.ts` for an example

```typescript
// Create mock state
const mockState = ref({ connected: false, npmUser: null, ... })

// Mock the composable
vi.mock('~/composables/useConnector', () => ({
  useConnector: () => ({
    isConnected: computed(() => mockState.value.connected),
    // ... other properties
  }),
}))
```

#### Playwright E2E tests (`test/e2e/`)

- A mock HTTP server starts automatically via Playwright's global setup
- Use the `mockConnector` fixture to set up test data and the `gotoConnected` helper to navigate with authentication

```typescript
test('shows org members', async ({ page, gotoConnected, mockConnector }) => {
  // Set up test data
  await mockConnector.setOrgData('@testorg', {
    users: { testuser: 'owner', member1: 'admin' },
  })

  // Navigate with connector authentication
  await gotoConnected('/@testorg')

  // Test assertions
  await expect(page.getByRole('link', { name: '@testuser' })).toBeVisible()
})
```

The mock connector supports test endpoints for state manipulation:

- `/__test__/reset` - Reset all mock state
- `/__test__/org` - Set org users, teams, and team members
- `/__test__/user-orgs` - Set user's organizations
- `/__test__/user-packages` - Set user's packages
- `/__test__/package` - Set package collaborators

## Submitting changes

### Before submitting

1. ensure your code follows the style guidelines
2. run linting: `pnpm lint:fix`
3. run type checking: `pnpm test:types`
4. run tests: `pnpm test`
5. write or update tests for your changes

### Pull request process

1. create a feature branch from `main`
2. make your changes with clear, descriptive commits
3. push your branch and open a pull request
4. ensure CI checks pass (lint, type check, tests)
5. request review from maintainers

### Commit messages and PR titles

Write clear, concise PR titles that explain the "why" behind changes.

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Since we squash on merge, the PR title becomes the commit message in `main`, so it's important to get it right.

Format: `type(scope): description`

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

**Scopes (optional):** `docs`, `i18n`, `deps`

**Examples:**

- `fix: resolve search pagination issue`
- `feat: add package version comparison`
- `fix(i18n): update French translations`
- `chore(deps): update vite to v6`

Where front end changes are made, please include before and after screenshots in your pull request description.

> [!NOTE]
> Use lowercase letters in your pull request title. Individual commit messages within your PR don't need to follow this format since they'll be squashed.

### PR descriptions

If your pull request directly addresses an open issue, use the following inside your PR description.

```text
Resolves | Fixes | Closes: #xxx
```

Replace `#xxx` with either a URL to the issue, or the number of the issue. For example:

```text
Fixes #123
```

or

```text
Closes https://github.com/npmx-dev/npmx.dev/issues/123
```

This provides the following benefits:

- it links the pull request to the issue (the merge icon will appear in the issue), so everybody can see there is an open PR
- when the pull request is merged, the linked issue is automatically closed

## Pre-commit hooks

The project uses `lint-staged` with `simple-git-hooks` to automatically lint files on commit.

## Using AI

You're welcome to use AI tools to help you contribute. But there are two important ground rules:

### 1. Never let an LLM speak for you

When you write a comment, issue, or PR description, use your own words. Grammar and spelling don't matter &ndash; real connection does. AI-generated summaries tend to be long-winded, dense, and often inaccurate. Simplicity is an art. The goal is not to sound impressive, but to communicate clearly.

### 2. Never let an LLM think for you

Feel free to use AI to write code, tests, or point you in the right direction. But always understand what it's written before contributing it. Take personal responsibility for your contributions. Don't say "ChatGPT says..." &ndash; tell us what _you_ think.

For more context, see [Using AI in open source](https://roe.dev/blog/using-ai-in-open-source).
